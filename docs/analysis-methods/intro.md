# ðŸ“¦ Analysis Methods

The DataTomeAnalysis class abstracts the implementation of a circular array in order to calculate the arithmetic average of its members.

It is an extension of the [DataTomeMvAvg](pathname:///docs/mvavg-methods/intro) class, with more statistical methods.

If you are used to the C++ Standard Library, it will be easier to learn the methods since they follow the same pattern of name and logic.

If you are looking for calculating a shorter average of the same data array more efficiently, check the new feature, [Partials](pathname:///docs/mvavg-methods/partials/intro).
