# ðŸ“Š Analysis Partials

The **Partials** are a **more efficient** way of calculating the average of one data array partial sizes by avoiding the recalculation of the entire array every time.

When you create a **Partial**, the structure will create a **reactive variable** behind the scenes. The name reactive represents how the variables will automatically update their values without more instructions.

It **avoids** creating a **new array** every time you want to calculate the average of a **different size of the same data**.

Reactive variables update reactively to push calls. Then, after creation, you **only need to care** about getting the **Partial result**.

When a partial is created, the structure will return an ID that will be used to get the partial results.

## ðŸ“¦ Analysis Partials Methods

Every method on Analysis follows the same pattern of name and logic, with a `partial_` prefix and receive `size_t partial_id` as an argument.

For example:

```cpp
TypeOfArray partial_minimum(size_t partial_id);
```
