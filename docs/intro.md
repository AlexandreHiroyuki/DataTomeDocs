# ðŸ’¾ Installation

1. Clone the repository and download the zip file at https://github.com/AlexandreHiroyuki/DataTome.
   Also, you can see and download all releases at https://github.com/AlexandreHiroyuki/DataTome/releases.
2. Drag and drop it on `Arduino/libraries/` folder.
3. Include it on your code.

```cpp
#include <DataTome.h>
```

:::tip

- You can also download and install the library through the official library manager on the Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/datatome/.
  Access https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries to see more details about installing libraries on Arduino IDE.

- **_â€”Recommended Platformâ€”_** Now it's possible to install this library on theÂ [PlatformIO Registry](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/alexandrehiroyuki/DataTome)!

# ðŸ’¡ Getting Started

1. You can easily try out the library by running the example code.
2. Just open the subfolder `DataTome/examples/`.
3. Then try compiling the `moving_average_print.ino`.
4. Open the serial monitor.
5. Then see the array magically moving and calculating it average!

# ðŸ“¦ Data Tome Methods

The **DataTome** classes abstracts the implementation of a circular array in order to calculate the arithmetic average of its members.
Because it is a circular array, the next input will replace the oldest element (represented by the first index), so it is also possible to call it a **FIFO queue**.

If you are used to the C++ Standard Library, it will be easier to learn the methods since they follow the same pattern of name and logic.
